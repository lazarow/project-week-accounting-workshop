For four days, you will work guided by an instructor on the automation of the accounting department in an imaginary company. On the last, fifth day, you (in pairs) will prepare your automation projects in the form of a 5-minute pitch.\n",

Regardless of Google Colab, you can run a notebook locally on your machine: in Jupyter Lab or VS Code (with the Jupyter extension). There are also alternative cloud platforms like Kaggle Kernels.\n",

        "- A notebook is a place to write programs, view their results, and write text.\n",
        "- Each rectangle containing text or code in a notebook is called a _cell_.\n",
        "- Text cells (like this one) are written in a simple format called [Markdown](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb).\n",
        "- Code cells contain code in the Python 3 language. Running a code cell will execute all of the code it contains.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please note that we use a notebook, but all the code written here can be run as a standard Python script file. See more details [here](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/) (however, do it later, it's not required for this lab).\n",
        "\n",
        "To open a notebook, you can upload it or open it from GitHub or Google Drive. The most user-friendly approach for saving a notebook is using Google Drive (so you should use one).\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "The memory state is preserved as you run different cells, i.e., all variables have their assigned values, libraries are imported and so on. We call it the REPL (read-eval-print loop) approach. You can re-run code cells as many times as you want. You can also restart a session, which will reset memory.\n",

Even experienced programmers make many errors. When you make an error, you have to find the source of the problem, fix it, and move on.\n",
